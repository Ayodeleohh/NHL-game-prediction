# NHL-game-prediction
Predicting NHL games using Scikit-Learn and Random Forest Classifier

This project was completed using Jupyter Notebook and Python utilizing Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-Learn.

The main focus of this project was utilizing Scikit-Learn's Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier in order to predict the winner of NHL games using historical data.

For learning purposes, this is my first attempt in learning Github, for starters I have simply uploaded the external images and the notebook into this repository in the event you would like to replicate this project for your own purposes.
